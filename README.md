# LSTM--GRU--Sentiment-analysis--and-Deep-Learning-Text-Classification
A deep learning NLP project for sentiment classification on Yelp reviews using TensorFlow Keras. The pipeline applies GRU and LSTM models with pre-trained and trainable GloVe embeddings, compares model performance, and benchmarks results against classical ML approaches for sentiment prediction.
